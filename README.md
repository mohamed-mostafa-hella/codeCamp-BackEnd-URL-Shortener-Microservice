# [URL Shortener Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice)

## Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://url-shortener-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/.

### steps. 

- You can POST a URL to /api/shorturl and get a JSON response with original_url and short_url properties. Here's an example: { original_url : 'https://freeCodeCamp.org', short_url : 1}

- When you visit /api/shorturl/<short_url>, you will be redirected to the original URL.

- If you pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain { error: 'invalid url' }.

- create hashing function for the original_url to create the short_url.

- short_url is now dynamic this make me create route dynamic change with the original_url.


## NOTE : what is the new...? => is made for self development it is not required in the freeCode Camp project.
- create hash function.
- make shortURL dynamic depend on original_url.
- create test api on [/api/test] to return var values to check what hapend.

## Note:
- like [ sample.env ] => Create .env file that contain [PORT = 'your port'].
